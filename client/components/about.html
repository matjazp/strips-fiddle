    <p>STRIPS-Fiddle is an online editor for creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIPS" target="_blank">STRIPS</a> automated planning programs using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Domain_Definition_Language' target='_blank'>PDDL</a>. STRIPS-Fiddle is powered by the node.js artificial intelligence library, <a href='https://github.com/primaryobjects/strips' target='_blank'>strips</a></p>

    <h2>What is STRIPS?</h2>

    <p>STRIPS is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling" target="_blank">automated planner</a> that can be used by intelligent agents and autonomous robots. It involves intelligently executing a sequence of actions in order to achieve a goal.</p>

    <p>STRIPS stands for "Standford Research Institute Problem Solver". It consists of an initial state, actions, and a goal state. By applying the actions over the initial state and all child states, a goal can be found.</p>

    <p>STRIPS uses simple definitions to define a world and available actions. Actions include preconditions (conditions that must exist in the present state) and postconditions (changes to be applied to the present state). States are represented by a series of literals and predicates. For example: holding(gold) has(shovel).</p>

    <p>Here's an example <a href="https://github.com/primaryobjects/strips/blob/master/examples/starcraft/domain.txt" target="_blank">domain</a> and <a href="https://github.com/primaryobjects/strips/blob/master/examples/starcraft/barracks.txt" target="_blank">problem</a> in PDDL that solves Starcraft build orders!</p>

    <p>One of the neat things about STRIPS is that you can apply various search algorithms to iterate the various states and find solutions. Common methods include breadth-first search, depth-first search, and A*.</p>
    <h2>How was this made?</h2>

    <p>STRIPS-Fiddle is powered by the <a href='https://github.com/primaryobjects/strips' target='_blank'>strips</a> node.js <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/strips' target='_blank'>library</a>.</p>

    <p>The strips library is an easy way to try out planning programs. By default, the library runs server-side in a node.js application. For STRIPS-Fiddle, the library is <a href='http://browserify.org/' target='_blank'>ported</a> to client javascript and runs in the browser!</p>

    <p>When you run a program in STRIPS-Fiddle, it's executed locally in the web browser and the output is displayed on the page.</p>

    <p>This web site was made with <a href='https://www.meteor.com/' target='_blank'>Meteor.js</a>.</p>
